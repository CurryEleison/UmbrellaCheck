This is a demo project to check today's weather conditions at
your location.

Location is discovered through html5 geolocation falling back 
to geoip if the user does not want to disclose location.

Weather is provided by weatherunderground API.

If there's a chance of rain a Yes will be displayed on screen. 
If weather promises to be clear a No.

The project is just a demo, but if anyone really cares about it
it is easily exapnded into something robust.
